                I am a full stack Applications Developer with a focus in scaled web platforms and 'software as a service' cloud products. I have a passion for creating beautiful highly usable interfaces and the APIs that power them. I work across many development stacks, but with a particular interest in Ember.js and Node.js. I'm most interested in positions that involve bringing applications and services to large user bases via cloud solutions such as Amazon.

                <span class="description">I and my team-mates own the Ember application that serves as the core UI for my company's cloud platform. I build the real­time communications capabilities of that system. My core product is a chat solution that is feature competitive with other name brand chat solutions on the market. I serve as the sole developer pushing the capabilities of our communications platform as well as continued assistance with developing the rest of our application's UI as well as occasional server bug fixes and features. My role encompasses the areas of Application Development, Application Architect, Product Owner and UI Designer, with a core focus on Development. The project started at Orgspan Inc, a small start­up which was acquired in May 2014, at which time my focus shifted much more heavily to Development and Architecture as I was able to bring in resources for the areas of Product Owner and UI Design.</span>

                <span class="description">I helped build and launch an Analytics API that processed all live data through the Rally ecosystem. The goal of the platform was to provide real time assistance in the areas of Agile planning and Team response time. I helped design and build the API platform, making core decisions and enhancements that helped shape the direction of the project. After completion of the API I headed up a project to build a Javascript platform on top of the API in order to facilitate our customers consumption of the data it provided. I designed a charting SDK that fit within the ExtJS ecosystem of Rally's UI. This allowed us to empower our customers to design and tweak their own charts through simple configurations, rather than requiring heavy front end development as was previously necessary. Utilizing my own SDK I provided a suite of reports that we used through­out our development teams at Rally as well as providing to our customers as launching points for crafting their own. I worked with Rally's Technical Account Managers to provide reports specific to various customer needs as well as working with customers directly through Rally's Hackathon program, which pairs Rally developers up with customers who have specific app ideas they want to see implemented.</span>

I was responsible for all test infrastructure development related to my areas of ownership. I also played the role of support for all of our beta customers who needed assistance with configuration or tuning in my product areas.</span>
